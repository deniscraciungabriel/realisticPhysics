# realisticPhysics
This is a simulation where you can throw a ball around different objects with realistic physics, all                     thanks to a Python module called "Pymunk". Pymunk can be integrated with Pygame (like in this case),                     which takes care of all the visuals whilst Pymunk takes care of the calculations. Everything can be                     changed as you like: gravity, mass, elasticity, friction, colors. The module takes care of the                     harder maths, but ball trajectory and everything else is done by hand as you can see from the GitHub                     repository of this project. Of course Pymunk and Pygame are required for this project to run.
